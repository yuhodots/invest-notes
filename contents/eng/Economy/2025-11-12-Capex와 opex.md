### Why Understanding Capex and Opex Matters
Even at the same revenue level, the path cash takes out of a business can look very different. Some companies tie up cash in factories and equipment (Capex), while others pour spending into headcount and marketing (Opex). This difference drives the income statement, cash flow statement, valuation, and even share price cycles. This post clarifies what Capex and Opex mean, how they differ by industry, and how Capex gets reflected in stock prices—all from an investor’s perspective.

### Capex vs Opex: The Language of Accounting and Cash Flow
- Capex (Capital Expenditure): Investment outlays for acquiring or improving long-lived assets such as machinery, plants, networks, and data centers. Recognized on the balance sheet as assets and then expensed over time via depreciation. Appears in cash flows from investing activities.
- Opex (Operating Expenditure): Expenses necessary for day-to-day operations such as salaries, rent, marketing, and maintenance. Expensed on the income statement as incurred, directly impacting operating income. Appears in cash flows from operating activities.

From an investor’s perspective, the key metric is Free Cash Flow (FCF). In simplified form, FCF = Cash Flow from Operations – Capex. Even with the same operating income, industries with high Capex tend to have lower FCF, while Opex-heavy industries convert to surplus cash more quickly.

##### Items on the Borderline
- Maintenance Capex vs Growth Capex: Maintenance preserves existing capacity; growth expands it. The former is essential, the latter is flexible depending on the cycle/demand. If a company doesn’t disclose the split, estimate it using depreciation and changes in production capacity.
- R&D: Under IFRS, certain development costs can be capitalized if criteria are met; under US GAAP, most are expensed. Even among tech companies, the Capex/Opex mix can differ by accounting framework.
- Leases: With IFRS 16/ASC 842, most operating leases are recognized on the balance sheet as assets and liabilities. Cash outflows are lease payments, but in accounting they appear as depreciation plus interest, so be careful when assessing capital intensity.

### Which Industries Are Capex- or Opex-Heavy
- High-Capex industries
  - Semiconductor manufacturing/equipment (Foundry, Memory, WFE): Fabs and tools dominate. Capex-to-sales can climb to 30%+ at times.
  - Telecom (5G/fiber), power and gas utilities: Long-dated, large-scale network and infrastructure Capex.
  - Energy (E&P, refining/petchem), metals/mining: Project-based mega Capex, influenced by commodity cycles.
  - Logistics/airlines/shipping: Aircraft, vessels, hubs/terminals require significant capital assets.
  - Data centers/cloud infrastructure (Hyperscalers, Colocation): Substantial Capex for servers, power, and cooling.
- High-Opex industries
  - Software/internet/platforms: While server leases and infrastructure Capex exist, personnel and marketing dominate relative to sales. High gross margins; S&M/R&D drive the expense base.
  - Education, consulting, healthcare services: People-centric models.
  - Content/entertainment: Production costs are often expensed as Opex (some are capitalized and amortized).

You can compare capital intensity using metrics such as Capital Intensity (Capex/Revenue), Asset Turnover (Revenue/Assets), Depreciation/Revenue, and FCF Margin.

### How Capex Gets Reflected in Share Prices
Capex has two faces: near-term cash outflow and ROE dilution, versus long-term growth and higher barriers to entry. Share prices tend to react as follows:

- Short-term derating vs long-term re-rating
  - Announcing large growth Capex: Multiples can compress in the near term on concerns about lower FCF and higher leverage. But if backlog, customer contracts, and pricing power make the IRR credible, multiples can re-rate when the buildout ramps and completes.
  - In regulated sectors like utilities and telecom, Capex is added to the Regulated Asset Base (RAB) and recovered through tariffs via an Allowed Return, making returns relatively stable.

- Cycle signals
  - Commodities/process industries: Industry-wide Capex cuts reduce supply, improving prices/spreads; share prices often bottom 12–24 months ahead. Conversely, late-cycle Capex overbuild can foreshadow margin pressure and derating.

- The ROIC spread is decisive
  - Whether a project’s IRR exceeds the WACC (ROIC > WACC) is central to valuation. The more a company discloses clear hurdle rates, cash payback, and sensitivity analyses, the more the market treats Capex as a growth engine.

- Accounting effects
  - Rising depreciation can suppress reported operating income, so investor communication often pivots to normalized EBITDA and FCF guidance. When demand disappoints, depreciation remains as a fixed expense, further damaging margins and inviting asset impairment risk—typically a drag on multiples.

### What Investors Should Watch: A Checklist
##### 1) Distinguish Maintenance vs Growth Capex
- Check whether the company explicitly discloses maintenance Capex.
- A rule-of-thumb floor for maintenance Capex: around depreciation expense, or the spend needed to sustain utilization/capacity. If it’s set sharply lower, question the quality.

##### 2) Demand and Pricing Defensibility
- Long-term contracts (offtake, take-or-pay), barriers to entry, regulatory frameworks.
- Product mix and pricing power. Stronger pricing power increases IRR visibility.

##### 3) Capital Structure and Liquidity
- Net debt/EBITDA, interest coverage, maturity profile. Ensure the Capex peak doesn’t collide with a maturity wall.
- Include lease liabilities in net debt to avoid understating leverage.

##### 4) Execution Risk
- Process complexity, supply chain (equipment lead times), history of cost overruns.
- Regulatory approvals/permitting and environmental delays.

##### 5) Capital Allocation Credibility
- Realized ROIC track record on past Capex.
- Management’s balance among dividends/buybacks/Capex. Beware “empire building” in upcycles.

##### 6) Quick-Compute Comparative Metrics
- Capital Intensity = Capex/Revenue trend.
- Incremental ROIC ≈ (Increase in operating income × (1 – tax rate)) / Cumulative growth Capex.
- FCF Yield = FCF/Market cap; scenario for normalized FCF post Capex peak.
- Use the combination of Asset Turnover and EBIT Margin (DuPont analysis) to gauge impact on ROE.

### Industry-Specific Investing Insights
- Semiconductors/equipment: Industry Capex guidance is a powerful leading indicator. The more customer diversification and node/tech transitions (e.g., EUV), the higher the barriers and the longer the structural tailwind—yet beware overinvestment at cycle peaks.
- Telecom/utilities: Capex ties directly to tariffs/regulation. For dividend investors, improving dividend capacity post Capex peak is key. Interest rates feed directly into valuation.
- Energy/resources: Check the conservatism of project IRRs versus commodity price decks. Capex restraint and stronger shareholder returns often catalyze multiple re-ratings.
- Software/SaaS: High-growth, Opex-heavy models. When revenue growth slows, Opex efficiency (declining S&M and R&D as a percentage of sales) is crucial for multiple defense. Capex profiles differ depending on whether data centers are owned.

### Putting It Into Practice: What to Look for in Filings
- Annual investment plan (capex guidance) and breakdown (plant/network/IT/environment).
- Maintenance vs growth split, and whether project-level IRR/payback is provided.
- Capacity change rates and ASP assumptions; backlog/long-term contracts.
- Depreciation outlook, net debt including lease liabilities, interest-rate sensitivity.
- Timeline to the Capex peak and the path to normalized FCF thereafter.

### Summary and Conclusion
Capex is a double-edged sword: it pressures near-term cash flow but raises long-term competitiveness and barriers to entry. Opex, by contrast, hits the P&L immediately and showcases growth pace—but inefficiency can quickly turn into losses. Capital intensity differs by industry, and even within an industry, stock performance diverges based on capital allocation skill.

Investors should 1) separate maintenance and growth Capex, 2) verify that IRR exceeds WACC, 3) check leverage and execution risk, and 4) read the phase of the Capex cycle. A post-announcement derating isn’t necessarily negative: with visible demand and high ROIC, a re-rating at completion can be a compelling opportunity. Conversely, large, low-conviction Capex and undisciplined Opex expansion are enemies of long-term returns. Let the numbers verify the story, and let the cycle play out—patience is the most practical way to read Capex and Opex.
