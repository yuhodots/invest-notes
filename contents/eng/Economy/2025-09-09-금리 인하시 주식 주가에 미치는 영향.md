### Rate Cuts and Stock Prices: Why the Market Is So Sensitive to the First Signal

Policy rate cuts have immediate yet nuanced effects on equities. Lower discount rates lift asset values, but if cuts reflect a weakening economy, earnings can soften. Ultimately, what matters is “why, by how much, and for how long” rates are cut. This post lays out the core mechanisms, historical context, style/sector sensitivities, and a practical positioning checklist.

### Two Channels: Discount Rates and Earnings

##### 1) Discount Rate Channel

A stock’s theoretical value is based on discounted cash flow (DCF), which converts future cash flows into present value. The discount rate reflects the risk-free rate, the equity risk premium, beta, and the capital structure via WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital). Central bank cuts typically lower the risk-free rate and corporate bond yields, reducing WACC and, for the same cash flow assumptions, lifting valuations.

- Simple perpetuity-with-growth example: with g=3%, if WACC falls from 9%→8%, the multiple moves from 1/(0.09-0.03)=16.7x to 1/(0.08-0.03)=20.0x—roughly a 20% multiple expansion.
- Long-duration equities, whose cash flows are weighted further out in time, are especially sensitive to discount-rate moves.

##### 2) Earnings & Credit Channel

Rate cuts ease financial conditions, reduce interest expense, lower refinancing burdens, and support rate-sensitive consumption (housing, autos) as well as corporate capex. The backdrop, however, is crucial.

- In an “insurance cut” regime supporting a soft landing, earnings outlooks tend to hold up or improve—positive for equities.
- By contrast, reactive cuts into recession can see wider credit spreads and weaker demand, prompting EPS downgrades and limiting early equity rebounds.

### Good Cuts vs. Bad Cuts: It’s About the Cycle and Expectations

##### Forward Pricing and “Surprise”

Market rates move ahead of policy rates. Fed funds futures/OIS and the Treasury curve price cuts in advance. By the time cuts arrive, “it’s already in the price,” so subsequent returns hinge on whether the magnitude and pace of easing surprise versus expectations. The trade is about the path and the tempo—not the headline.

##### Lessons from History

- Mid-cycle adjustments like 1995–96 and 2019 were generally supportive for equities: low hard-landing risk and preemptive cuts early in the growth slowdown.
- Recessionary cutting cycles (2001, 2007–09) saw continued declines or elevated volatility early on, as earnings damage and credit stress outweighed the support from cuts.
- Bottom line: performance depends more on the context (growth, inflation, credit conditions) and the surprise versus expectations than on “cuts per se.”

### Who’s More Sensitive: Style, Sector, and Geography

##### Growth vs. Value

- Growth: Benefits most from multiple expansion as discount rates fall, especially software/platforms, AI, and innovation themes with long-duration cash flows. Still, in macro downturns, even tech is not defensive if EPS deteriorates.
- Value: Less multiple sensitivity, but tends to outperform in cyclical upturns on earnings leverage during recovery.

##### Small Caps

- Many firms carry higher leverage and floating-rate exposure, making interest expense relief meaningful. When credit spreads tighten alongside cuts, beta can be outsized.
- If financial conditions remain tight and high-yield spreads are wide, rebounds can be delayed.

##### By Sector

- Rate beneficiaries: Homebuilders, Consumer Discretionary, selected Industrials, and REITs—all direct beneficiaries of lower mortgage and lending rates.
- Mixed: Financials. Repricing of deposit/loan rates, net interest margin (NIM), and credit costs can offset one another.
- Defensives: Utilities and Staples can cushion volatility. Lower long-end yields and dividend appeal can bolster relative performance.

##### Commodities, the Dollar, and Emerging Markets

- If Fed cuts lead to a weaker dollar, that’s supportive for commodities and EM assets. However, if global demand is slowing, commodities can face offsetting headwinds.
- EM equities are highly influenced by the triangle of USD/local rates/commodity prices; watch “the direction of the dollar.”

### Timing and Positioning: A Practical Checklist

##### 1) Identify the Cycle

- Leading real-economy indicators: ISM/PMI, initial jobless claims, retail sales, housing starts
- Financial conditions index (FCI), high-yield spreads, bank lending standards (BLS)
- Inflation trends: headline vs core, especially services/shelter
- Earnings outlook: direction and magnitude of consensus EPS

##### 2) Curve and Real Yields

- The shape of curve steepening: during cutting cycles, “bull steepening” often favors defensives and growth.
- Falling real yields are the key driver of growth multiple expansion. Watch TIPS yields and the 10Y real.

##### 3) What’s Priced In

- Check the path (number/speed) of cuts implied by futures
- Trade the surprise: larger-than-expected cuts, a lower dot plot, QT (quantitative tightening) pace adjustments, etc.

##### 4) Positioning Ideas (by Scenario)

- Soft landing/insurance cuts: Quality Growth + housing/Consumer Discretionary + selective small-cap beta
- Cuts with recession risk: Defensives/Staples/high-quality dividend payers, reduce credit exposure, favor cash-generative large caps
- Inflation re-acceleration risk: Anticipate slower cuts/repricing by trimming duration exposure; reassess Value/Energy weights

##### 5) Company-Level Checks

- Debt maturity profile, fixed vs floating mix, interest coverage
- Pricing power, margin structure, inventory/demand sensitivity
- Sustainability of buybacks and dividends

### Risks and Paradoxes: When Cuts Backfire

- Reactive, lagging cuts: If the economy/earnings are already deteriorating rapidly, cuts can be read as a “fear signal,” pushing equities lower.
- Stubborn inflation: Cutting too early can reignite inflation, undermine policy credibility, and raise volatility.
- Banking/credit risks: Sharp curve shifts affect NIMs and deposit stability; constrained credit supply can cap equity rebounds.
- “Buy the rumor, sell the news”: The first cut can trigger profit-taking, and if it coincides with earnings season, volatility can spike.

### A Simple Framework for Portfolio Application

- Three-step check: (1) Nature of the cut (insurance vs recession defense) (2) Direction of real yields and the curve (3) Credit spreads
- Sizing: Balance multiple-sensitive assets (Growth/REITs/Small Caps) with earnings-leverage assets (Value/Cyclicals)
- Phased approach: Given front-running, use staggered entries, hedges (inverse/options), and preset rebalancing rules
- Fundamentals first: If valuations are already stretched, the benefits of cuts may be limited

### Key Takeaways

- Rate cuts work through two channels: valuation expansion via lower discount rates and earnings support via easier financial conditions.
- The impact size hinges on the “reason and timing” for cuts. Insurance cuts/soft-landing scenarios are supportive; recession-response cuts may be limited early on.
- Sensitivity varies by style and sector. Growth/REITs/Small Caps are more discount-rate sensitive; Value/Cyclicals hinge on economic recovery. Financials are mixed.
- Reading the futures-implied path together with real yields, the curve, and credit improves positioning precision.
- It’s the post–first cut path and surprises that drive returns. A checklist-driven, phased approach works best.

In short: Rate cuts are often equity-friendly, but leadership depends on why, by how much, and how fast policy eases—and you get more durable results by tracking the trio of real yields, credit, and EPS.
