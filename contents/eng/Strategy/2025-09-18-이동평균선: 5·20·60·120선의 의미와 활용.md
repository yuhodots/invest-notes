### The Essence of Moving Averages: A Simple Yet Powerful Thermometer for the Market
To novice investors, charts can look like a tangle of lines. Among them, the Moving Average (MA) is the most basic and useful tool for taking the market’s “average temperature.” In Korea, the 5-, 20-, 60-, and 120-day moving averages are used most often, representing short-term, short-to-intermediate, intermediate, and intermediate-to-long-term trends, respectively. This post explains these four lines intuitively, shows how to apply them to real trades, and covers common pitfalls and risk-management tips.

### Understanding the Structure and Time Sense of Moving Averages
A moving average smooths price over a set period to reveal trend. It’s fundamentally a lagging indicator, but it organizes volatility so you can read the bigger move and use it as a clue for support/resistance.

##### The Difference Between SMA and EMA
- Simple Moving Average (SMA): The arithmetic mean of the last N closes. Intuitive to interpret and widely used.
- Exponential Moving Average (EMA): Puts greater weight on recent data. Responds faster but can be more sensitive to noise.
Beginners can start with SMA; add EMA when you want higher short-term sensitivity.

##### 5-Day MA: Very Short-Term Sentiment
- Meaning: The balance of buying and selling over roughly one trading week (based on Korean trading days).
- Use: Confirm short-term momentum and time entries for day/swing trades. If price holds above the 5-day MA and its slope is rising, the short-term trend is likely to have momentum.
- Caution: Expect frequent violations and whipsaws in range-bound markets.

##### 20-Day MA: The One-Month Average Stamina
- Meaning: The average cost basis over about a month. A reference level many participants watch.
- Use: A pullback-buy support in trending markets. In uptrends, pullbacks toward the 20-day MA often become opportunities.
- Caution: In sharp selloffs, 20-day support can fail easily—confirm with volume.

##### 60-Day MA: The Quarterly Flow
- Meaning: Roughly a 3-month average; an inflection zone for institutions and intermediate-term investors.
- Use: A watershed for judging the intermediate trend. Diagnose trend by whether the close stays above/below the 60-day MA for consecutive days.
- Caution: When the line is flat, price can whip around it and amplify losses.

##### 120-Day MA: The Six-Month Major Current
- Meaning: A 6-month average reflecting a stock’s intermediate-to-long-term stamina and the market’s broader cycle.
- Use: A long-term holding baseline and a gauge for major trend shifts. After price moves above the 120-day MA and its slope turns up, trend-continuation odds improve.
- Caution: Retests are common right after breakouts; waiting for confirmation is better than chasing.

### Practical Application: Playbooks by Scenario
Moving averages don’t give “the answer”; they improve probabilities. The scenarios below use rules simple enough for beginners to follow.

##### Trend Following: Bullish Alignment and a Slope Filter
- Bullish Alignment: Price > 5 > 20 > 60 > 120, with all slopes pointing upward.
- Entry: After a pullback toward the 20-day MA, a wide-range bullish candle with rising volume and a close that reclaims the 5-day MA.
- Exit: Two consecutive daily closes below the 20-day MA, or a 5/20-day Death Cross.
- Point: The slope and the separation between MAs matter more than the Golden Cross itself. Upward-sloping lines improve the odds.

##### Buying the Pullback: Respecting, Not Fading, the 20-Day
- Conditions: The 60- and 120-day MAs are sloping up, and price pulls back to the 20-day MA.
- Signal: A touch or approach to the 20-day MA followed by an intraday reclaim of the 5-day MA the next day, with volume above the 5-day average.
- Stop: If price closes below the 20-day MA and makes a lower low, cut immediately. For stop placement, a more conservative 1–1.5x ATR buffer is recommended.
- Scaling In: Buy half above the 20-day MA and add the other half on a slight undercut. Invalidate the setup if the 60-day MA is violated.

##### Catching a Mid-Term Reversal: The 60/120-Day Crossover
- Context: After a long decline, a flattening 60-day MA and a narrowing gap following a Death Cross with the 120-day MA can signal base-building.
- Entry: When the 60-day MA turns up and price closes above the 120-day MA, then confirms support on a pullback (retest) to the 120-day MA.
- Hold: Stay in while the close holds above the 60-day MA; reduce if the 60-day slope rolls over.

##### Risk Management: Rules Drive Results
- Position Sizing: Cap max loss per trade at 0.5–1% of capital. Size positions to the stop distance.
- Trailing Stop: For trend leaders, scale out on a close below the 20-day MA. For high-volatility names, take partial profits off the 5-day MA.
- Event Risk: Earnings, the resumption of short selling, and announcements of seasoned equity/rights offerings can invalidate MA analysis. Reduce exposure around events or exit and re-enter after confirmation.

### Market Regimes and Timeframes: Same Lines, Different Reads
##### Range vs. Trend
- Range-Bound: The 5- and 20-day MAs cross frequently, causing whipsaws. A 20-day mean-reversion approach works better: trim when price is stretched near range resistance; scale in near lower support.
- Trending: The MA ribbon aligns and fans out. Skip chasing; wait for pullbacks and add on a reclaim of the 20-day MA.

##### Single Stocks vs. Indexes
- Large Caps/Indexes: Lower volatility makes the 60- and 120-day MAs more reliable. Approach with an intermediate-term lens.
- Small Caps/Theme Stocks: Higher volatility and gaps demand faster decisions off the 5- and 20-day MAs—and stricter stop discipline.
- Overseas Markets: Even with a similar number of trading days, volatility structures can differ. Substituting 10/50/200-day MAs works on the same principles.

### Common Pitfalls and a Checklist
##### Common Pitfalls
- Ignoring Lag: MAs are averages of the past; they’re not for picking exact bottoms/tops.
- Overtrusting Signals: Golden/Death Crosses fail often when used alone. Judge together with slope, volume, and candle structure.
- Overfitting: Don’t generalize parameters that only worked in a specific window.
- Ignoring News/Events: Gap moves from news can easily break MA logic.

##### Execution Checklist
- Today’s Close: How is price aligned relative to the 20/60/120-day MAs?
- Slope Check: How many of the four slopes point up? If they’re flat, wait.
- Volume Filter: On breakouts/support bounces, is volume ≥120% of the 5-day average?
- Stops/Targets: ATR-based stop width set and a target of at least 2R?
- Event Calendar: Earnings, ex-dividend dates, and policy catalysts checked in advance?
- Position Management: Predefine how much to trim on a 20-day MA break.

### Wrap-Up: Read the Lines in Context
The 5-, 20-, 60-, and 120-day MAs reflect the average cost bases and sentiment of different investor cohorts. The 5-day shows short-term momentum, the 20-day one-month stamina, the 60-day the quarterly trend, and the 120-day the major trend. But MAs are lagging summaries—your odds improve when you read slope, alignment, volume, and price action together. Apply simple rules consistently, make stops and position sizing a habit, and moving averages can become a trustworthy compass even for beginners.
